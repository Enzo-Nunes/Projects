# ASA (Análise e Síntese de Algoritmos)
## Analysis and Synthesis of Algorithms

This repository contains the projects completed as part of the ASA course at IST. The course primarily focused on learning and determining the best algorithm for a series of problems. Two **C++** projects and a small **Python** project were developed. This folder also includes a small project (project0) that served as a small introduction to the course. All projects (except 0) are accompanied by a project report.

## Project 0: Friendships (Practice Run)

This was a small project that consisted of simple directed graph theory problems. It did not count towards any grade and served only as practice for the following projects.

## Project 1: Metal Plate (DP)

In this project we were asked to the determine the most optimal way to cut a rectangular plate given the possible cut shapes and their respective price. The problem consisted of a two-dimensional version of the well known Rod-Cutting problem, to be solved using Dynamic Programming.

Final Grade: **20/20**

## Project 2: Disease Transmission (Graph Theory)

In this project we studied the spread of a disease through a population. We were tasked with determining the longest possible spread path the disease could follow. The problem essentially consisted of finding the longest path in a given unweighted directed graph. If the graph had cycles, we first had to collapse them by finding its SCCs.

Final Grade: **20/20**

## Project 3: Christmas Toys Factory (LP)

In this project we learned how the PuLP python library worked for solving Linear Programming problems. The year I attended this course was the first that contained this third project and, as such, it was short and simple. It basically consisted of interpreting the problem, modeling it as a linear programming problem and writing a program to solve it.

Final Grade: **19.70/20**
