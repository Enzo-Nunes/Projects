# PE (Probabilidade e Estat√≠stica)
## Probability and Statistics

This repository contains the project completed as part of the PE course at IST. The course primarily focused on learning the basic concepts and techniques in Probability and Statistics, including probability distributions, hypothesis testing, and both point and interval estimation. The project was developed in **R** and consisted of 10 separate exercises.

## Probability Distributions and Statistical Analysis

The first 3 exercises focused on ploting graphs about different datasets. Exercises 4, 9 and 10 were multiple choice questions focused on calculating probabilities and hypothesis testing. Exercises 5 through 8 were open questions that required us to calculate probabilities, maximum likelihood estimators, and confidence intervals.
