# Machine Learning

This repository contains the projects completed as part of the *Aprendizagem* course at IST. The course's projects were organized as a series of practical homeworks, each of them focusing on different aspects of machine learning. In each of these projects we learned and practiced how to use `Python` and its libraries to solve machine learning problems.

## Homeworks

Each homework folder contains the following files:

- **Enunciado.pdf**: The homework statement.
- **Resolução.pdf**: The homework solution, including our explanation for every exercise.
- **\*.ipynb**: Jupyter notebook files containing any supporting code we used to solve the homework.

Final Grade: **20/20**
