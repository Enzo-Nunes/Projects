# Machine Learning

This course's projects were organized as a series of practical exercises, each of them focusing on different aspects of machine learning. In each of these projects we learned and practiced how to use `Python` and its libraries to solve machine learning problems.

## Homework Practical Exercises

Each exercise folder contains the following files:

- **Enunciado.pdf**: The exercise statement.
- **Resolução.pdf**: The exercise solution, including our explanation for every task.
- **\*.ipynb**: Jupyter notebook files containing any supporting code we used to solve the exercise.

Final Grade: **20/20**
