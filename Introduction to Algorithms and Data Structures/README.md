# Introduction to Algorithms and Data Structures

This course primarily focused on learning the basics of algorithms and an introduction to data structures, as well as two projects in `C` programming language.

## Public Transportation System

The projects consisted of the development of a software application for the management of a public transport system. The first project consisted on the fundamentals of the this system. The second project was just an extensions and enhancement of the first. As so, it consisted of implementing better code practices and a few new commands.

Final Grade: **20/20**

## Extra

This folder contains projects from this course I developed in the years after completing it. I developed these projects to further improve my programming skills, my knowledge of algorithms and data structures, and as leisure. As I already had completed this course, I was able to develop these projects in my own pace, in a more structured way and with better programming understanding.

Particularly, the 2024-2025 project was developed as a personal challenge to learn the `Go` programming language. As such, I developed the project in `Go` instead of `C`.
