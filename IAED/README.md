# IAED (Introdução aos Algoritmos e Estruturas de Dados)
## Introduction to Algorithms and Data Structures

This repository contains the projects completed as part of the IAED course at IST. The course primarily focused on learning the basics of algorithms and an introduction to data structures, as well as two projects in **C** programming language.

## Public Transportation System

The IAED projects consisted of the development of a software application for the management of a public transport system. The first project consisted on the fundamentals of the this system. The second project was just an extensions and enhancement of the first. As so, it consisted of implementing better code practices and a few new commands.

The course also included a small final practical test to ensure the students truely had the skills and were developing the projects by themselves. The grade in this final evaluation violently limited the maximum grade achieved by the student.

Final Grade: **20/20**

## Extra (Next Year's projects)

This folder contains the IAED project I developed the year after I completed my course of IAED. In other words, the project given to the students one year behind me. I developed these projects to further improve my **C** skills, my knowledge of algorithms and data structures, and as leisure. As I already had this course, I was able to develop these projects in my own pace, in a more structured way and with a better understanding of the language.

Their course format was way better structured. They only had one project, which consisted of developing a software application for the management of parking lots. This project was more robust and complex than the ones I had to develop, as it was a combination of two projects.
