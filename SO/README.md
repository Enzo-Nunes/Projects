# SO (Sistemas Operativos)
## Operating Systems

This repository contains the projects completed as part of the SO course at IST. The course primarily focused on learning the inner workings of an operating system and how to develop programs that interact with it. Two **C** projects were developed.

## Project 1: Multi-process and Multi-thread File Processing

We were given the source code of a program that processed files and printed the results to the standard output. We were tasked with making the program multi-threaded and multi-process, and to print the results to a file instead of the standard output.

Final Grade: **15.21/20**

## Project 2: Client and Server

We were given a modified version of the source code of the previous project completed, without multi-processing. We were also given the souce code of the client. We were tasked with transforming the past project to a server-like program with multi-threading and to implement the API for the client to interact with this server.
