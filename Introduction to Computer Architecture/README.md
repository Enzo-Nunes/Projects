# Introduction to Computer Architecture

This course primarily focused on learning the basics of computer architecture and on a project developed in a specific `Assembly`-based language created by the course professor called **PEPE-16**, which we studied throughout the course.

## Asteroids Game

The project consisted of developing a game where the player controls a spaceship and has to fire in 3 different directions to destroy asteroids to avoid colliding with them and to collect energy. The objective is to stay alive as long as possible.

This project was developed by a group of 3 students.

Final Grade: **19.2/20**
