# IA - InteligÃªncia Artificial
## Artificial Intelligence

This repository contains the project completed as part of the IA course at IST. The course focused on the basic concepts and techniques in AI, including problem-solving, search algorithms, and heuristics. The project was developed in **Python** and consisted of implementing a solution to the Pipemania game using search algorithms.

## Pipemania

Pipemania is a game where the player must connect a series of pipes to create a continuous flow of water across the board. The player can rotate the pipes to connect them in the correct way. We were given the already implemented search algorithms and a template with which to implement the game. We then had to model the game as a search problem and choose the most appropriate algorithm to solve it.

This project was developed by a group of 2 students.

Final Grade: **19/20**
