# FP (Fundamentos da Programação)
## Programming Fundamentals

This repository contains the projects completed as part of the Fundamentos da Programação course at Instituto Superior Técnico. The course primarily focused on **Python** programming.

## Project 1: Tools

In this project we developed 3 separate tools:
- Text justification tool.
- Elections solver using the D'Hondt method.
- Linear system of equations' solver using the Jacobi Method.

Final Grade: **19.5/20**

## Project 2: Minesweeper

This project consisted of designing and coding the well-known videogame minesweeper from scratch.

Final grade: **19.55/20**

## Extra (Next Year's projects)

This folder contains the FP projects I developed the year after I completed my course of FP. In other words, projects from the students one year behind me. I developed these projects to further improve my python skills and as leisure. As I already had this course, I was able to develop these projects in my own pace, in a more structured way and with a better understanding of the language.

Their course format was way better structured. Their first project was based on learning recursion through obtaining information on a ractangular board. The second project consisted of developing the japanese game "Go". Project 1 was used as a base for project 2.
