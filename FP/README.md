## Programming Fundamentals

This repository contains the projects completed as part of the Fundamentos da Programação course at Instituto Superior Técnico. The course primarily focused on **Python** programming.

## Project 1: Tools

In this project we developed 3 separate tools:
- Text justification tool.
- Elections solver using the D'Hondt method.
- Linear system of equations' solver using the Jacobi Method.

## Caloiros 2023 (Next Year's projects)

This folder contains the FP projects I developed the year after completing my course of FP. In other words, projects from the students one year behind me. I developed these projects for fun and to further enhance my python skills.

Their course format was way more well structured. Their first project was based on learning recursion through obtaining information on a ractangular board. The second project consisted of developing the japanese game "Go". Project 1 was used as a base for project 2.
