# Projects from LEIC-T at IST

I'm currently working on a computer science bachelor's degree at Instituto Superior Técnico.

This is a repository with all finished University projects I've previously worked on. 

## Description

The repo is subdivided into Course folders, which all have a README file explaining the Course and projects related. Each Course folder might be subdivided into project folders.
Each of these project folders have several files which include test files, the project itself, the PDF with the problem to be solved, and more.
