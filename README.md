# Projects from LEIC-T at IST

I'm currently working on a computer science bachelor's degree at Instituto Superior Técnico.

This is a repository with all finished University projects I've previously worked on. 

## Description
The repo is subdivided into Course folders, which all have a README file explaining the Course and projects related. Each Course folder might be subdivided into project folders.
Each of these project folders have several files which include test files, the project itself, the PDF with the project statement, and more.

Some projects that were developed in group might be in separate repositories, owned by one of the group members. In those cases, a link for that repository will be provided bellow in that project's listing.
