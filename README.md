# Projects developed at IST

Private Repo with all my College projects.

## Disclaimer

This repository includes all the projects I developed along my Academic Path at IST.
Under no cirmumstances is anyone to share anything in this repository with anyone, ever.
If I shared these files with you, it means you are really important to me and I trust you very much.
If anyone asks you for anything inside, tell them to talk to me. Even if you trust them to the soul, do NOT share any content from here.
If you break this rule, you risk ruining all my (and your!) academic life.
Plagiarism is a VERY serious problem in the academic environment and the institution we study at takes it VERY seriously.

Don't break that trust.
Thank you.

## Description

The repo is subdivided into subject folders, which are in turn subdivided into the project folders.
Each of these project folders have several files which include test files, the PDF with the problem to be solved, the project itself and more.
