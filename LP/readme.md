# LP (Lógica para Programação)
## Programming Logic

This repository contains the projects completed as part of the LP course at Instituto Superior Técnico. The course primarily focused on learning the basic logics of programming and a *Prolog* project.

## School Database

The LP project is a software application developed as part of the LP course at IST. It aims to demonstrate various programming concepts and techniques.

It's focused around a fictional story of a school's database that was attacked by a hacker. The developer needs to write several prolog functions to recover the school courses's metadata, such has location and schedule, and essentialy restructure the whole school's database.

The project also includes a final challange for the student, unrelated to the story of the project. It's a permutation problem involving a dinner table and several restrictions to the placement of guests.

Final Grade: *20/20*
