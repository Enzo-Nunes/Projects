# Logic for Programming

This course primarily focused on learning the basic logics of programming and a `Prolog` project.

## School Database

The project is a software application which aims to demonstrate various programming concepts and techniques.

It's focused around a fictional story of a school's database that was attacked by a hacker. The developer needs to write several prolog functions to recover the school courses's metadata, such as location and schedule, and essentially restructure the whole school's database.

The project also includes a final challenge for the student unrelated to the story of the project, but nonetheless required to reach the maximum grade. It's a permutation problem involving a dinner table and several restrictions to the placement of guests.

Final Grade: **20/20**
