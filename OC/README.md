# Computer Organization

This course focused on learning more low-level computer architecture concepts. The projects were organized as a series of practical exercises, each of them focusing on different aspects of computer organization. The first two projects were developed in `C`. The third project did not involve building new code, but rather refactoring existing `Assembly` code.

## Practical Exercises

The first exercise consisted on implementing three different cache simulators. The second exercise was based on optimizing the first one through hardware profiling. The third exercise was based on refactoring and optimizing existing `Assembly` code by analysing the pipeline of the CPU.

Final Grade: **19.28/20**
